**ATM Interface Java Program**

This Java program simulates a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface. 

It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking their account balance. 

The program is structured with two main classes: BankAccount, which handles the account balance and transactions, and ATM, which provides the user interface and interacts with the BankAccount class. 

The application is designed to be run in a command-line environment, where users can input their desired actions and receive real-time feedback on their transactions.
